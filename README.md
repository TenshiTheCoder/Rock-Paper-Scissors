# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a project consisting of writing a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors! that will be played exclusively in the console.
I will practice writing pseudocode and identifying and solving different errors within the console and codebase

UPDATE: 2/20/25

Logic was refactored to use DOM methods and be played with a simple UI. May be styled later!
